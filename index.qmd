Welcome to the website for Dr. Lisa A. Williams, Professor in the School of Psychology, UNSW Australia.

Current social psychological research in the lab includes projects investigating the prosocial functions of vicarious pride, gratitude, and moral elevation. We are also using cross‐sectional, experimental, experience sampling, and longitudinal approaches to examine the impact of emotional experience on blood donation behaviour.

Other work explores how equity, diversity, and inclusion can be promoted in STEM, in higher education, and beyond. Projects include empirical research, systematic reviews, and ‘on the ground’ programs. This work is underpinned by a commitment to data-driven approaches and a remit to reduce barriers to full participation for all members of society.
